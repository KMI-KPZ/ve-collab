Definitions  1.1. “Contributor”       means each individual or legal entity that creates, contributes to the      creation of, or owns Covered Software.  1.2. “Contributor Version”       means the combination of the Contributions of others (if any) used by a      Contributor and that particular Contributor’s Contribution.  1.3. “Contribution”       means Covered Software of a particular Contributor.  1.4. “Covered Software”       means Source Code Form to which the initial Contributor has attached the      notice in Exhibit A, the Executable Form of such Source Code Form, and      Modifications of such Source Code Form, in each case including portions      thereof.  1.5. “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”      means       a. that the initial Contributor has attached the notice described in         Exhibit B to the Covered Software, or       b. that the Covered Software was made available under the terms of version         1.1 or earlier of the License, but not also under the terms of a         Secondary License.  1.6. “Executable Form”       means any form of the work other than Source Code Form.  1.7. “Larger Work”       means a work that combines Covered Software with other material, in a separate      file or files, that is not Covered Software.  1.8. “License”       means this document.  1.9. “Licensable”       means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether at the      time of the initial grant or subsequently, any and all of the rights conveyed by      this License.  1.10. “Modifications”       means any of the following:       a. any file in Source Code Form that results from an addition to, deletion         from, or modification of the contents of Covered Software, or       b. any new file in Source Code Form that contains any Covered Software.  1.11. “Patent Claims” of a Contributor        means any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method, process,       and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such Contributor that       would be infringed, but for the grant of the License, by the making,       using, selling, offering for sale, having made, import, or transfer of       either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.  1.12. “Secondary License”        means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, the GNU Lesser       General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU Affero General Public       License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those licenses.  1.13. “Source Code Form”        means the form of the work preferred for making modifications.  1.14. “You” (or “Your”)        means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this       License.

For purposes of this       definition, “control” means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause       the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or       otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the       outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.   2. License Grants and Conditions  2.1. Grants       Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,      non-exclusive license:       a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)         Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,         modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its         Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as         part of a Larger Work, and       b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for         sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions         or its Contributor Version.  2.2. Effective Date       The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become      effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes      such Contribution.  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope       The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this      License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution      or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section      2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:       a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software, or       b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor         Version), or       c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its         Contributions.       This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or      logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the      notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses       No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License      (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted      under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation       Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions      are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the      rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use       This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable      copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions       Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in      Section 2.1.   3. Responsibilities  3.1. Distribution of Source Form       All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the      terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form      of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how      they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or      restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form       If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:       a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost         of distribution to the recipient, and       b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,         or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for         the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’         rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work       You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the      Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software      with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered      Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits      You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of      such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at      their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of      either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices       You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including      copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations      of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered      Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent      required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms       You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf      of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any      jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License    to the maximum extent possible, and (b) describe the limitations and the code    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to    understand it.  5. Termination  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License      shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to      termination shall survive termination.  6. Disclaimer of Warranty     Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License    except under this disclaimer.  7. Limitation of Liability     Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such    party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.  8. Litigation     Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall    prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.  9. Miscellaneous     This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe    this License against a Contributor.   10. Versions of the License  10.1. New Versions        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a       distinguishing version number.  10.2. Effect of New Versions        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of       the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or       under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license       steward.  10.3. Modified Versions        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to       create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified       version of this License if you rename the license and remove any       references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such       modified license differs from this License).  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses       If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With       Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the       notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.  Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice        This Source Code Form is subject to the       terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.       2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not       distributed with this file, You can       obtain one at       http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.  Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice        This Source Code Form is “Incompatible       With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by       the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0."

"knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api";"2.1.0-rc.1";"LGPL-3.0";"https://github.com/chemmedia/knowledgeworker-embedded-asset-api";"";"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.    0. Additional Definitions.    As used herein, 'this License' refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the 'GNU GPL' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    'The Library' refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.    An 'Application' is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.    A 'Combined Work' is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the 'Linked Version'.    The 'Minimal Corresponding Source' for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.    The 'Corresponding Application Code' for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.    2. Conveying Modified Versions.    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of    this License applicable to that copy.    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are    covered by this License.     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license    document.    4. Combined Works.    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are    covered by this License.     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license    document.     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.     d) Do one of the following:         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying        Corresponding Source.         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked        Version.     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL    for conveying Corresponding Source.)    5. Combined Libraries.    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,    conveyed under the terms of this License.     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library."

For legal entities, 'You' includes any entity which controls, is      controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of      this definition, 'control' means (a) the power, direct or indirect,      to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by      contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent      (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such      entity.  2. Source Code License.       2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.      The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property      claims:           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or           trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,           modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original           Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or           as part of a Larger Work, and            (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or           selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,           sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the           Original Code (or portions thereof).            (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are           effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes           Original Code under the terms of this License.            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is           granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code, 2)           separate from the Original Code,  or 3) for infringements caused           by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the           combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.       2.2. Contributor Grant.      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license            (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or           trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,           display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications           created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an           unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code           and/or as part of a Larger Work, and            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or           selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone           and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions           of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have           made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that           Contributor (or portions thereof), and 2) the combination of           Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor           Version (or portions of such combination).            (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are           effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of           the Covered Code.            (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is           granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the           Contributor Version, 2)  separate from the Contributor Version,           3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of           Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made           by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the           Contributor Version) or other devices, or 4) under Patent Claims           infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by           that Contributor.  3. Distribution Obligations.       3.1. Application of License.      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include      an additional document offering the additional rights described in      Section 3.5.       3.2. Availability of Source Code.      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an      Executable version available, and if made available via Electronic      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.       3.3. Description of Modifications.      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.       3.4. Intellectual Property Matters           (a) Third Party Claims.           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code           distribution titled 'LEGAL' which describes the claim and the           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.            (b) Contributor APIs.           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must           also include this information in the LEGAL file.                 (c)    Representations.           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by           this License.       3.5. Required Notices.      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.       3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such      terms You offer.       3.7. Larger Works.      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, and (b)      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to      understand it.  5. Application of this License.       This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.  6. Versions of the License.       6.1. New Versions.      Netscape Communications Corporation ('Netscape') may publish revised      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version      will be given a distinguishing version number.       6.2. Effect of New Versions.      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to      Covered Code created under this License.       6.3. Derivative Works.      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that      the phrases 'Mozilla', 'MOZILLAPL', 'MOZPL', 'Netscape',      'MPL', 'NPL' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of      this License.)  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.       COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS,      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.  8. TERMINATION.       8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License      shall survive.       8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom      You file such action is referred to as 'Participant')  alleging that:       (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of      the 60 day notice period specified above.       (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that      Participant.       8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or      license.       8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder      prior to termination shall survive termination.  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.       UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.       The Covered Code is a 'commercial item,' as that term is defined in      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 'commercial computer      software' and 'commercial computer software documentation,' as such      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those      rights set forth herein.  11. MISCELLANEOUS.       This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this      License.  12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.       As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.  13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.       Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as      'Multiple-Licensed'.  'Multiple-Licensed' means that the Initial      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.  EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.       ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License      Version 1.1 (the 'License'), you may not use this file except in      compliance with the License.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License, and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files, and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works, and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works, within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works, or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

'Work' shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).      'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.      'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of     the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate     as of the date such litigation is filed.   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You     meet the following conditions:      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or         Derivative Works a copy of this License, and      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices         stating that You changed the files, and      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of         the Derivative Works, and      (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed         as part of the Derivative Works, within the Source form or         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works, or,         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed         as modifying the License.      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with     the conditions stated in this License.   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License, and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files, and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works, and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works, within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works, or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
